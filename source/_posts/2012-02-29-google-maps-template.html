title: Google Maps Template
---

<p>I often find clients want good Google Maps integration on their sites &mdash; <a href="http://www.jarredchristmas.com">Some more than others</a>! After the first few, I decided to put together a handy Photoshop document containing all the common assets needed when coming up with concept designs involving maps.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/google-maps-template/images/google-maps-template.jpg" alt="Google Maps Template" /></p>
<p>Some components in the template have been converted to vector for easy resizing, while others (such as the zoom control) have been split into parts. I've tried to keep all components as pixel perfect as possible.</p>
