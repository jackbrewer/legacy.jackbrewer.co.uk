<p>This is the result of a long evening playing with box shadows and gradients &mdash; an iPhone icon made with CSS.</p>
<div class="example">
	<span class="iphone">iPhone</span>
</div>
<p class="note">Make sure you hover for yet more outrageously complicated styling.</p>
<p>You've probably seen similar experiments where people have used hundreds of empty <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements to recreate similar details to a pixel perfect level. I decided to take a different approach and write my optimal HTML first.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="html">&lt;span class="iphone"&gt;iPhone&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>
<p>That's all there is! Although limiting, I still managed to achieve a fairly impressive result using this one element and its <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> pseudo elements. The <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element itself forms the iPhone body, the <code>:after</code> pseudo element handles the lock / home screen whilst the <code>:before</code> pseudo element forms the home button.</p>
<p>The bulk of the styling makes use of multiple background gradients, sizes and positions. Combine that with the fact that every CSS3 property is duplicated 5 times with various vendor prefixes and the overall CSS file length of 200 lines doesn't seem too crazy.</p>
<div class="example float-right col-4">
	<span class="iphone zoom">iPhone</span>
</div>
<p>Here is the exact same icon, this time scaled up three times to allow you to see the finer details (or lack of).</p>
<p>There is a tiny amount of JavaScript in use on this demo &mdash; it updates the <code>:after</code> pseudo element's <code>content</code> property to ensure the icon is always displaying the correct time.</p>
<p>You may also notice at this zoom level that the icon is modelled on an iPhone 3GS &mdash; this demo has been living on my hard drive for a while!</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is an experiment and was a great learning experience. I would never recommend using something this complicated or pointless on an actual site.</p>
