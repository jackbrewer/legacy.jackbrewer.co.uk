title: Disabling Caps Lock on OSX
---

<p>The majority of the code I write is CSS or HTML and I have spent a long time setting up hundreds of <del datetime="2012-01-02T22:22:10+00:00">TextMate</del> <ins datetime="2012-01-02T22:22:10+00:00">Sublime Text 2</ins> tab triggers<sup><a href="#disabling-caps-lock-on-osx-1">[1]</a></sup> to speed up the process. The thing that slows me down again is my clumsy, non-touch typing finger frequently mashing the caps lock key instead of the tab key.</p>
<p>Turns out it is easy to disable caps lock in OSX. Go to <em>System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys</em> and choose 'No Action' in the Caps Lock dropdown.</p>
<p>In the few months that I've had it disabled, I can count the number of times I've needed caps lock on one finger. Compared to the frequency of my accidental activations beforehand, I'm definitely happy with the choice!</p>
