One of the hardest things about delivering flat Photoshop mockups to clients is the lack of interaction that you would get with a live demo. Showing off your well considered hover state, tooltips or other interactive elements can be quite confusing.

A good way to help this confusion is by including cursors in you designs to help illustrate the intended action.
