title: Mapping A Hash Keyboard Button In OSX
---

<p>When I switched to using a Mac, one of the very few problems I had was the lack of a hash key on my (UK) keyboard. For the average user, this probably isn't too much of an issue but for someone who codes, I can't live without it! <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> is slightly too awkward a shape to pull off frequently with one hand.</p>
<p>To remedy my problem, i needed to find a donor key on my keyboard. The <kbd>ยง</kbd> key looked like the perfect candidate (I even had to google it to find out what it was!).</p>
<blockquote><p>The section sign (ยง, Unicode U+00A7, HTML entity &amp;sect;), also called the "double S", "sectional symbol" or signum sectionis, is a typographical character used mainly to refer to a particular section of a document, such as a legal code.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well now you know too.</p>
<p>Now for the magic. If you don't already have it, you will need to create a <code>DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code> file here:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="plain">~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code></pre>
<p>Once you have this file, open it and add:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="plain">{
  /* Map # to ยง key*/
  "ยง" = ("insertText:", "#");
}</code></pre>
<p>Save that, restart your Mac and you will be the proud owner of a new hash key!</p>
