title: Multiple Document Windows In Photoshop

---

Multiple document windows are a little known Photoshop feature that saves a lot of zoom effort! To open a second window for an open document, go to *Window > Arrange > New Window for \[filename]*.

This comes in very useful when you need to zoom in to a high level but would still be able to see realtime changes to your document at 100%. I mainly use this when designing icons, with two or three copies of a document open simultaneously, each at a different zoom level.
