title: Disabling Caps Lock on OSX
---

The majority of the code I write is CSS or HTML and I have spent a long time setting up hundreds of <del>TextMate</del> <ins>Sublime Text 2</ins> tab triggers<sup>[1](#disabling-caps-lock-on-osx-1)</sup> to speed up the process. The thing that slows me down again is my clumsy, non-touch typing finger frequently mashing the caps lock key instead of the tab key.

Turns out it is easy to disable caps lock in OSX. Go to *System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys* and choose 'No Action' in the Caps Lock dropdown.

In the few months that I've had it disabled, I can count the number of times I've needed caps lock on one finger. Compared to the frequency of my accidental activations beforehand, I'm definitely happy with the choice!
